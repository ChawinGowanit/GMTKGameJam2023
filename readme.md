## Gameplay

For each loop you will be rigging the gacha pull for 3 person.

Every person trying to pull the gacha have their own preference, and they might have a passive skill which affected the tier of the ball inside the machine or have multiple pulls. Because luck is also part of skills ¯\*(ツ)*/¯.

When a person come in to pull the gacha, you’ll be given their name, backstory, what they want and their passive skill. After that you’ll see inside of the gachapon machine with 5 gacha balls. You have to navigate the right gacha ball to the exit by controlling the Gachapon Machine.

After rigging every pulls, you’ll be peeking at their gacha-addicted group chat to see their reaction whether they got what they want or not.

- Lucky: Spawns 3 rainbow, 1 gold and 1 silver tier balls.
